Baby says, "I can't come with him"
And I had read all of this in his eyes
Long before he even said so, why go? I asked
You know and I know why

And it'll be just as quiet when I leave
As it was when I first got here
And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything

Take care, I've been hurt before
Too much time spent on closing doors
You may hate me, but I'll remember to love you
Goodbye, don't cry, you know why

And it'll be just as quiet when I leave
As it was when I first got here
And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything

All the waves of blame arrange as broken sceneries
As they steal your best memories away
So what if I was someone different in your only history?
Would you feel the same as I walk out the door?
Never to see your face again
Never to see your face again

And it'll be just as quiet when I leave
As it was when I first got here
It'll be just as quiet when I leave
As it was when I first got here
And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything

And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything
And don't expect anything
To change when I leave
