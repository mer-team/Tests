You put the boom boom into my heart (do do)
You send my soul sky high when your loving starts
A jitterbug into my brain (Yeah, yeah)
It goes bang bang bang until my feet do the same

But something's bugging me, something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
You left me sleeping in my bed
I was dreaming but I should've been with you instead

Wake me up before you go go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go go, woah
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah yeah

You take the grey skies out of my way (do do)
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame (yeah yeah)
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
It makes me crazy, when you act so cruel
Come on baby, let's not fight
We'll go dancing, everything will be alright

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go woah
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby, woo!

Jitterbug

Cuddle up baby, move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed
They can dance, we'll stay home instead (yeah yeah)

Jitterbug (Oooh)

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go whoa
Take me dancing tonight

Wake me up before you go-go, ( Don't you dare)
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo (To leave me hanging on like a yo-yo)
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high (take me dancing, I wanna go, go, go)
Wake me up before you go-go (Oh!)
Cause I'm not planning on going solo (I wanna go, go, go)
Wake me up before you go-go (go,go, go,go,go)
Take me dancing tonight

Wake me up before you go go (yeah)
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo (yeah yeah)
Wake me up before you go go (yeah)
Take me dancing tonight (ooh)
Wake me up!
