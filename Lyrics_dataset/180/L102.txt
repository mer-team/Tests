I'm a rolling thunder, a pouring rain 
I'm coming on like a hurricane 
My lightning's flashing across the sky 
You're only young but you're gonna die 

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives 
Nobody's putting up a fight 
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell 
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you 

Hell's Bells 
Yeah, Hell's Bells 
You got me ringing Hell's Bells 
My temperature's high, Hell's Bells 

I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine 
If you're into evil you're a friend of mine 
See my white light flashing as I split the night 
'Cause if God's on the left, then I'm stickin' to the right 

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives 
Nobody's puttin' up a fight 
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell 
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you 

Hell's Bells 
Yeah, Hell's Bells 
You got me ringing Hell's Bells 
My temperature's high, Hell's Bells 

yeow 
Hell's Bells, Satan's comin' to you 
Hell's Bells, he's ringing them now 
Hell's Bells, the temperature's high 
Hell's Bells, across the sky 
Hell's Bells, they're takin' you down 
Hell's Bells, they're draggin' you around 
Hell's Bells, gonna split the night 
Hell's Bells, there's no way to fight, yeah 

Ow, ow, ow, ow 

Hell's Bells
