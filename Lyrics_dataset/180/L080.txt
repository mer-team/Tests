I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white

I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas' be white
