I'm coming down to see ya,
I'm looking for fast and cheap,
I'm looking for the back of the streets,
(Yeah-ow)
I'm gonna get experience,
I came to see the candy man,
To turn it up and drown,

Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
(I'm gonna get experience)
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
Turn it up and drown,

I'm going on a laser beam,
to shoot some Cherries down,
I pick a little free agent,
I got myself a fine wide smile,
so baby for the first time,
I need a little sugar 'n' spice,
(Yeah-ow)
I wanna see the city lights,
I'm gonna find a number,

Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
I'm looking for fast and cheap,
Feels just like it should,
I'm looking for the back of the streets,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
I'm gonna get experience,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
I'm here to see the candy man,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,

Sugar-spice, I'm on the phone,
I'm outside,
In a mean little street from the back town,
I want you,
I'm gonna lick you up and down,
Feels good,
She said it would feel that good,
and it does,

(Yeah-ow)
(Yeah-ow)
and it feels, it feels, it feels,
and it feels, it feels, it feels,
and it feels, it feels, it feels,
just like you,
just like you said it would,
(Yeah-ow)

Feels just like it should,
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should,
I'm coming down tonight to taste y'all,
Sugar-spice, I want you, a sexy girl,
slips in, it feels good,
(I love it when you tell me)
Feels just like it should
