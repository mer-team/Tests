Sometimes you think you'll be fine by yourself
'Cause a dream is a wish that you make all alone
It's easy to feel like you don't need help
But it's harder to walk on your own

You'll change inside when you realize

The world comes to life and everything's bright
From beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find the beauty you are
When you open your heart and believe in
The gift of a friend
The gift of a friend

Someone who knows when you're lost and you're scared
And there through the highs and the lows
Someone you can count on, someone who cares
Beside you wherever you'll go

You'll change inside when you realize

The world comes to life and everything's bright
From beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find the beauty you are
When you open your heart and believe in
The gift of a friend

And when your hope crashes down, shattering to the ground
You, you feel all alone
When you don't know which way to go
And there's no signs leading you home
You're not alone

The world comes to life and everything's bright
From beginning to end
When you have a friend by your side
That helps you to find the beauty you are
When you open your heart and believe in
When you believe in
You can believe in
The gift of a friend
