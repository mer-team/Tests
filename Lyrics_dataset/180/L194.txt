Come on, step inside, and you will realize.
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be.
What's your vision? You'll see, what do you expect of me?
I can't live that lie.

Hey, I sing my words,
I'm fucked at dealing,
With your life,
Dead bodies everywhere.

You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

Let me strip the plain, let me not give in.
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies.
Never had the chief, don't lay that shit on me.
Let me live my life. 

Hey, I sing my words,
I'm fucked at dealing,
With your life,
Dead bodies everywhere.

You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

You want me to be, something I can never ever be! 

Hey, I sing my words,
I'm fucked at dealing,
With your life, 
Dead bodies everywhere. 

You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

Dead bodies everywhere!
