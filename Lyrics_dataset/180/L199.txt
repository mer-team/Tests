I drove by all the places
We used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss
How it felt, the way you tasted

And even though your friends tell me
You're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Even though he's right beside you?

When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder
Was it just a lie?
If what we had was real
How could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind
You didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
Forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me
They're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I admit I feel alone

All my friends keep asking
Why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy
And it hurts that you've moved on

It's hard to hear your name
When I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened
Was it just a lie?
If what we had was real how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind
You didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
Forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind
You didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
Forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

I'm not fine at all
I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all
