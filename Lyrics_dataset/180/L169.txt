I want to be the smile
I want to see the change
I want to be your friend from the start
And once it starts, it never ends
I want to be your pal, I want to be around
I want to be your friend when you are down
I want to be the sunshine
On your smiling face

I want to be the moon
No, I want to be ocean
Where all we do is float under the sun
On the rolling sea
Oh, I want to be the sunshine
No, I want to be the moonshine
I want to be the night time lullaby
When you're so afraid

And I think I found a way
To put a smile on your lonely face
I think I found a way
A way to break down all the walls
I think I found a way to say
I think I found a way to say hello
I think I found a way
Without saying anything at all

And I think I found a way
To put a smile on your lonely face
I think I found a way
A way to break down all the walls
I think I found a way to say
I think I found a way to say hello
I think I found a way
Without saying anything at all
