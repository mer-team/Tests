It's not.. what you thought...
When you first... began it.
You got... what you want...
Now you can hardly stand it, though,
By now you know, it's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop,
Till you wise up.

You're sure... there's a cure...
And you have finally found it.
You think... one drink...
Will shrink you to... your underground
And living down, but it's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop,
Till you wise up.

Prepare a list for what you need,
Before you sign away the deed,
'Cause it's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop...
It's not going to stop,
Till you wise up.

No, it's not going to stop,
Till you wise up.
No, it's not going to stop,
So just give up
