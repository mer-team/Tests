Where do you go when your luck runs out?
Yeah, where do you go?
Where do you go when you're down?

And where do you go when you feel like crying?
Where do you go?
Where do you go when you're down?

Won't you come inside with me dear?
You could stay inside with me dear.
Can't you see it's gonna to rain?

And how do you feel when the lights go out?
How do you feel?
And how do you feel alone?

And how do you feel when there's no one there
On the other end of the phone?

Won't you come inside with me dear?
Just stay inside with me dear.
Can't see you see it's going to rain?

Yeah, can't you see it's gonna rain?
It's gonna rain

Don't you wanna get old?
Don't you wanna get dry?
Don't you wanna stay?
Can't you see it's gonna rain?

So won't you come inside with me dear?

Cause I can see it's gonna rain?
I can see it's gonna rain.
Can't you see it's gonna rain?
I can see it's gonna rain.
