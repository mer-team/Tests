its been a long cold winter without you
i've been crying on the inside over you
just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
its been a long cold winter since that day

its hard to find
hard to find
hard to find the strength now but i try
and I don't want to
don't want to
don't want to speak now
of what's gone by
Cos no matter what i say
no matter what i do
i cant change what happened
No matter what i say
no matter what i do
i cant change what happened

You just slipped through my fingers
and i feel so afraid
You just slipped through my fingers
and i have paid

Cos no matter what i say
no matter what i do
i cant change what happened
No matter what i say
no matter what i do
i cant change what happened
no no I can't change

just slipped through my fingers
and i feel so afraid
You just slipped through my fingers
and i have paid
