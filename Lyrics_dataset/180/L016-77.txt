It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Into the boundaries
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
And it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
No sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstandings
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act

We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
No sacrifice at all

I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
I gave my heart
