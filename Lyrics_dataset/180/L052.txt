Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the six-o-nine goes roaring down the creek
Pastor Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really lookin' fine for eighty four
And she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a man down on the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural, old man Clay would say
Cause' he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch
