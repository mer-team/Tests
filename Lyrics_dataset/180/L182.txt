Look, 
If you had 
One shot, 
Or one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
In one moment 
Would you capture it 
Or just let it slip? 

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes 
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stagnant he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

The soul's escaping, through this hole that its gaping 
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's
Close to post-mortem, It only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada. And so the soap opera
Is told, itunfolds, I suppose it's old partna
But the beat goes on , da-da-dum da-dum da-dah 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the 
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of 
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, This is my life and
These times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna, 
Baby mama drama screamin' on her too much 
For me to want to say in one spot, another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got 
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
