Yes indeed I'm alone again
And here comes emptiness crashing in
It's either love or hate
I can't find in between
'Cause I've been with witches
And I have been with a queen

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day

Wish there was something I could say or do
I can resist anything but the temptation from you
But I'd rather walk alone
Than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself
Than let you drag me on down

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
And now it's just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day

Yesterday seems like a life ago
'Cause the one I love
Today I hardly know
You I held so close in my heart oh dear
Grow further from me with every fallen tear

It wouldn't have worked out anyway
So now it's just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day
For now it's just another lonely day
For now it's just another lonely day
