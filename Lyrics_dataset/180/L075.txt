Hey! c'mon!
But they don't hear me though
But they don't hear me though,
But they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't

I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
And got blood on my dick cause I fucked a corpse (c'mon!)
I'm a nasty nigga, when you pass me nigga look me in my eyes (what!)
Tell me to my fucking face that you ready to die (c'mon!)

Yo! don't you get the picture? niggas can't touch me (uhh!)

I got choice, to rip my slug or take apart a door
And enough crazy niggas behind me to start a war (c'mon!)
So what you want nigga? help, cause youse about to rest (uh!)
When I'm fed, red cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothing but make you look a little thicker (yea!)
Cause in the dark, you ain't nothing but a lil' nigga (what!)
And if you'd been thinking about that shit you did
You wouldn'ta brought the joint, wit you kid,
Now I'ma have to get you kid, and split your wig, wit the machete (what!)
I bring beef to niggas, and string em out, like spaghetti (c'mon!)
You ain't ready, nor can you stand how I'm bringin it (uh!)
I'm givin it is how I'm livin it so I'm swingin it (uh!)
Red dot on your head, cause youse in mid range
Red dot on your chest, opens up your rib cage
