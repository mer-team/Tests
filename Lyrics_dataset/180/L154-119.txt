Hi, hi! we're your weather girls 
Ah-huh 
And have we got news for you 
You better listen!
Get ready, all you lonely girls 
And leave those umbrellas at home. 
Alright! 

Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's raining men! Hallelujah! It's raining men! amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Hallelujah! 
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amennnn!

I feel stormy weather 
Moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder 
Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's raining men! Yeah!

Humidity is rising, barometer's getting low

It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah! 
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
