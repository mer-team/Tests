How I needed you
How I bleed now you're gone
In my dreams I can see you
But I awake so alone

I know you didn't want to leave
Your heart yearned to stay
But the strength I always loved in you
Finally gave way

Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Somehow I knew you could never stay
And in the early morning light
After a silent peaceful night
You took my heart away

In my dreams I can see you
I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you
It feels so real

And I still feel the pain
I still feel your love
I still feel the pain
I still feel your love

Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Somehow I knew you could never stay
And in the early morning light
After a peaceful night
You took my heart away
I wish you could have stayed
