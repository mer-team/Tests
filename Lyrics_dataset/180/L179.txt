There is a land an ancient land 
It bears a vast and rugged face
It spirits deep haunting and free
It calls to you it calls to me
Come find your soul within my depths
Come make of me your homeland true

This is our land
we are its people
A nation that's free to realise its dream
A dream that's for all who dwell in this land
to live as one people one people one land

There is a people an ancient people
Their spirits rest deep in this land
Their dreamtime myth story and faith
make this land a sacred place

They seek of all a true embrace
that reconciles all that we are

This is our land
we are its people
A nation that's free to realise its dream
A dream that's for all who dwell in this land
to live as one people one people one land

And from distant shores many have come
To find their home in this great Southern land
where the Spirit yearns and seeks to unite us all

This is our land
we are its people
A nation that's free to realise its dream
A dream that's for all who dwell in this land
to live as one people one people one land
