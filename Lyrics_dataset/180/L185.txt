I miss those blue eyes
How you kiss me at night
I miss the way we sleep

Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe

But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

And now,
I miss everything about you
I can't believe that I still want you
And after all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you

I see your blue eyes
Everytime I close mine
You make it hard to see
Where I belong to
When I'm not around you
It's like I'm alone with me

But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

And now,
I miss everything about you (still you're gone)
I can't believe that I still want you (and loving you, I never should've walked away)
And after all the things we've been through (I know I never gonna go away)
I miss everything about you
Without you

But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

And now,
I miss everything about you (still you're gone)
I can't believe that I still want you (and loving you, I never should've walked away)
And after all the things we've been through (I know I never gonna go away)
I miss everything about you
Without you
