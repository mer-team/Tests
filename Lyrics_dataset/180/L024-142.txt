Sunrise
Sunrise
Looks like morning in your eyes
But the clock said 9:15 for hours

Sunrise
Sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said
oh, oh, oh
To you

Surprise
Surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise
Surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

Then I say
oh, oh, oh
To you

And now the night
will throw its cover down on me again
Oh, And if I'm right
It's the only way to bring me back

oh, oh, oh
To you
oh, oh, oh
To you
