Darling are you feeling
The same thing that I'm seeing
The troubles of the day

Took my breath away
Took my breath away

Now you're no longer talking
And I'm no longer listening
There's nothing left to say

Said it anyway
Said it anyway
And I want you not
And I need you not

I'm dying
Cause this is the saddest song I've got
The saddest song I've got
Darling are you healing
From all the scars appearing
Don't it hurt a lot
Don't know how to stop
Don't know hot it stops
Now there's no sense in seeing
The colours of the morning

Hold the clouds at bay
Chase them all away
Chase them all away

And I'm frozen still
Unspoken still
Heartbroken
Cause this is the saddest song I've got
The saddest song I've got
