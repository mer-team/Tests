Many people
Tell you that they're your friend
You believe them
You need them
For what's round the river bend

Make sure that you're
Receiving the signals they send
'Cause, brother
You've only got two hands to lend

Maybe
There's someone who makes you weep
And some nights
Loom up ahead
When you're asleep

Some days
There's things on your mind you should keep
Sometimes
It's tougher to look than to leap

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Better watch out for the skin deep
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Better watch out for the skin deep

(Brother, watch out)
Watch out for the skin deep
(Brother, watch out)
watch out for the skin deep
Better watch out for the skin deep

One day
The track that you're climbing gets steep
Your emotions are frayed
And your nerves
Are starting to creep

Just remember the days
As long as the time that you keep
Brother, you'd better watch out for the skin deep

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Better watch out for the skin deep
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Better watch out for the skin deep

(Brother, watch out)
Watch out for the skin deep
(Brother, watch out)
Watch out for the skin deep
Better watch out for the skin deep

(Brother, watch out)
Watch out for the skin deep
(Brother, watch out)
Watch out for the skin deep
Better watch out for the skin deep

(Oooh)
