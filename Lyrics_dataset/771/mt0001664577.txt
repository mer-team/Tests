Yeah!
This song's about a high-class model over in Paris, France (Oh Cindy C.)
If I get a camera, tell me will U dance? (Will U play with me?)
If I take a picture in the middle of the night (Oh Cindy C.)
Will U funk with me, sugar? (Will U funk with me?)
Say it's alright, come on (Say it, say it)

(Cindy C., play with me)
(I will pay the usual fee)
Ah Cindy C. (What's it gonna be?)
Will U play with me? (What's it gonna be?)
(Cindy C., play with me)
(I will pay the usual fee)
Ah Cindy C. (What's it gonna be?)
I'll pay the fee (Cindy C.)

Super-fine heifer, U're so bloody vogue (Super fine)
I knew U would be trouble (trouble, trouble) from the word go (go, go)
I'll give U 7 sips of elderberry wine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
Maybe we'll unlock the secrets of your mind

(Cindy C., play with me)
(I will pay the usual fee)
Ah Cindy C. (What's it gonna be?)
Will U play with me? (What's it gonna be?)
(Cindy C., play with me)
(I will pay the usual fee)
Ah Cindy C. (What's it gonna be?)
I'll pay the fee (Cindy C.)

The passion's in the mix (Serve it up, Sheila)
Drink it quick Cindy – shit!
Where'd U get that beauty mark?
Baby, U and I should be undressing

Don't all girls look the same?
They don't? Oh, what a shame
Cindy, Cindy - I'll pay the usual fee
What's the matter, don't U like me?

(Poppy, tell me what it's all about)

I'm talkin' 'bout a long crucial leg

(Cindy C. – listen 2 me)

Girl, if I have 2 beg

(She's so tired)

I'ma see U in your birthday suit 2night

(Look at me)
(She doesn't look as good as I do)

I'm sure U're quite intelligent

(U think she does, but think again)
(See? How 'bout that?) (Ha, ha, ha)

A whiz at math and all that shit
But I'm, I'm a tad more interested in flyin' your kite 2night

(Look at her, she can't even walk in those shoes)
(I can walk better than that)
(She can't even dance)
(I would put somethin' on her she ain't never seen before)

Baby, is that alright?

(Cindy C.)

Oh Cindy C., will U play with me?
I'll pay the usual fee

2 organ solos 2 go

Oh Cindy C. {repeat}
(Yeah)

Oh Cindy C., will U play with me?
Oh Cindy C., I will pay the fee
Ah Cindy C., will U play with me?
Ah Cindy C., I will pay the fee

Help me! (Ah shit)
Uh!

Excuse my savoir-faire
But baby, I'm dyin' 2 take U everywhere (Oh yeah?)
I wanna show U 2 my friends (Ha ha ha)
Because baby, U're the living end (Tell me now)
Baby, U have a debt worth winning
I can feel your ice is thinning
Like a frozen pond in spring (Woo)
Your furry melting thing awaits me (Ah)
Your furry melting thing awaits me and my 6-string
(Oh Cindy C., will U play with me?)

(Cindy, where are U?)
Come on Cindy (Oh my God)
Come on Cindy (Wait)
Don't U wanna play with me? (Uh yes, no, wait)
Don't U wanna play with me? (Yes)
What's the matter with me, Cindy? (Nothing)
Ahhh!

Shockadelia!

Oh Cindy C., won't U play with me?

Music is the key 2 set yourself free
From depression, drugs and increasing poverty
The key is 2 the lock, the lock is on the door
The door has a knob that U never turned before
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock
Cuz there's the key 2 unlock the body
Place it like that 2 open up the door
The door 2 the house 4 the people galore
The beat won't stop till the J.M. jocks
And he jacks the box till the party rocks
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot
And believe it or not, all the troubles U forgot
It's just that easy if U want it 2 be
4 all the fellas and the young ladies
So ease your mind and set yourself free
2 the mystifying music that we call Cindy C.

Oh Cindy C., won't U play with me?
Oh Cindy C.
