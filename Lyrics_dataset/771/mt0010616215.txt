You can run but you can't hide from the westside
Night stalker, shit talker, run and tell them mr l.m.
Nigga with the gat and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rolling with the fo' chase ya through south-central
Monkey-wrench ho's should know that, she'll get the balzac
Cause I'm not staving, but fuck that
Johnny carson ho' never had me on the late night show
Coming with the shit that'll hitch
Steady mobbing cause the flavours good
There goes the neighbourhood nigga with the third album
How come he don't fall off?
Rolling with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know anita, she can get the pita
Eat 'em up yum, and your flawed
Mutha-fuck billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator.

Check your head for the new style
Fuck lawerence powell and presino, wynd and koon
Pretty soon we'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothing but dodge for the system
Fighting with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up denny
Niggaz are sick of your white mans tricks with no treat
Thats right, now it's on, on sight
You call me a muslim, no I'm not a resident, still got my vote in
Farrakhan for president, a white america, I'm tearing ya
A new ass ho', who's the nigga with the new black
Strolling to your suburb house and I douse with gas
Now who's cleaning up trash?
Eat 'em up yum, and your flawed
Mutha-fuck billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator.

Get my black rag showing and I'm ? ? ? ? ?
Kiss my grips like ? ? ? or melos diner
I'm meaner than a mutha-fucking hyena, chasing antelope
Put a chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantelope
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogï¿½s, boy I can sling 'em
Ratta-tat-tat on your noggin
Cause ice will cream your ass like ? ? ? ? chocolate
I get crazy when I catch a rap
Even be flipping the toungue like ? ? ? ? das-efx
So who is ice cube?
I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracka
Get the polly, whack her, ? ? ? ? is a devil shit-packer
Coming with a crazy pitch
And the statue of liberty ain't nothing but a lazy bitch
Don't wanna give up the crack to the black
But you call it racial, if we go and break the ho'
But eat 'em up yum and your flawed
Mutha-fuck billboard and the editor
Here comes the predator
