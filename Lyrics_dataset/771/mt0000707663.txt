Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes, ah

When she walks it's like a samba
That sways so sweet and swings so gently
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes, ah

Ooh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks ahead not at he

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
She smiles but she doesn't see

Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks ahead not at he

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
She smiles but she doesn't see

She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
She just doesn't see
