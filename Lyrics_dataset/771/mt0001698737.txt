Everybody's building the big ships and boats

Some are building up monuments, others are jotting down notes.

Everybody's in despair!  Every girl and boy!  But when Quinn the Eskimo gets there, everybody jump for joy!

Cmon, without.  Cmon, within.  You've not seen nothin like the Mighty Quinn.

Now, I like to do just like the rest you know I  like my sugar sweet.

But darling fumes, and making haste, that ain't my cup of meat!

Everyone's just swinging underneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb.

But when Quinn the Eskimo gets there, them pigeons'll rum to him.
