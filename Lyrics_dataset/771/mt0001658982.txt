If I was a seagull high and aloof
I'd sail to the highest perch on your roof
But I ain't no seagull, you know my name
And the wind's blowin' fortune, the wind's blowin' pain
And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky

If I was a puppy dog in the early dawn
I'd make it to your house and sleep on your lawn
But I ain't no puppydog, you know my name
And the wind blows fortune, the wind blows pain
And so it goes, nobody knows
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky
How to get to the sky, how to get to the sky
