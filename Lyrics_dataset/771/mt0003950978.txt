I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
Am, am, am, am, am, am, am, am, ow

He been gone since three thirty (three thirty)
And coming home lately at three thirty (three thirty)
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot, and, baby, you gone get it
Now, I ain't tripping, ah; I ain't twisting, ah
I ain't demented, huh; well, just a lil' bit, huh
I'm kicking asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame; don't come home, babe

[Chorus:]
I'm breaking dishes up in here
All night (uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man (oh)

I'm still waiting; come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I am burning is your attire
I'm getting restless
I'm getting testy
And I can't believe he is always out all night and never checks in
Is he cheating? 
Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Chorus]

I don't know who you think I am, I am, I am, I am
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come, I'm a huff and puff and blow this, blow this whole
Blow this, blow this
I'm a blow this, blow this whole
Blow this, blow this
I'm a blow this, blow this whole
Blow this house, house down
Dishes breaking, dishes breaking, dishes...

I'm breaking dishes up in here
All night (uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man (fight a man)
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man (oh)

Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin'
(Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin'
(Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin'
(Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin'
(Dishes, dishes, dishes)
