Don't wanna open your heart
You're afraid from the start
That a new love's gonna let you down
There is something you should know
Before you give up and go
I don' believe in the run around
I just want to define myself
And show you how l feel

If a promise ain't enough
Then a touch says everything
Got to hold you in my arms
Till you feel what I mean
Know that my heart just teIls me what to say
But words can only prove so much
If a promise ain't enough

Hold onto my love
Though my words can't describe
How I'm feeling all inside
Does my touch say anything to you
L'm not afraid to take time
Cause I know you'lI find
That l'm real and my touch is true
It's taken a lifetime to find my heart
And I give it all to you

If a promise ain't enough
Then a touch says everything
Got to hold you in my arms
Till you feel what I mean
Know that my heart just teIls me what to say
But words can only prove so much
If a promise ain't enough

It took a lifetime to find what I want
I won't let it get away

If a promise ain't enough
Then a touch says everything
Got to hold you in my arms
Till you feel what I mean
Know that my heart just teIls me what to say
But words can only prove so much
If a promise ain't enough
