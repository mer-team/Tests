Got something for you, darling
That you never, never had
Got something for you, darling
That you never, never had
Good lovin', good lovin'
Made me feel so glad

Got something for you, baby
Make my love be true
Got something for you, baby
Make my love be true
Good lovin', good lovin'
Never part, the world is you

True, fine lovin'
A whole lotta huggin'
Nothing but trouble
Baby, I need your good lovin'
