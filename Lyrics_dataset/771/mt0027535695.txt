You look at me that way I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
The way that you love me the way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames

Baby I'm burnin' out of control baby I'm burnin' body and soul
Hot as a pistol that flamin' desire baby I'm burnin' you've got me on fire
I'm on fire

This red hot emotion puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the 4th of July
There's no use in fighting this fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly

Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin' baby I'm burnin'
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
Baby I'm burnin' out of control...
