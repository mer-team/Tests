Guide a truth 
Prevail and ride 
Into the black hole 
Searching the crystal 
Making the veins bleed 
The source of consciousness 
Alive 
Crystalline resonance 
Into the black hole 
Searching the crystal 
Making the veins bleed 
A deep breath before the plunge 
One million voices 
Dispelling 
A thousand faces 
Disarming 
Running thru the darkness 
Holding hearts in my eyes 
Falling short of gauntlet 
Covered in blood-sucking flies 
The touch is cold 
I tore a path screaming through wind and blood 
I will it all 
Burning deep in my skull
