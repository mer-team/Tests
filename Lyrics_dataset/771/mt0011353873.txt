Sons of vengeance, can you rescue me 
They got me tied up to an old oak tree 
They had me screamin' and alone in the night 
I'm beginning to see what's wrong and what is right 
What is wrong and what is right, oh, what is wrong and what is right 

The gates was gettin' rusty, as we sailed into the dark 
The stars were out and shinin' against the moonlit hour 
The wolves were out and howlin', most of the time 
And I was cold and shiverin' and bleedin' in the night 
Bleedin' in the night, oh, bleedin' in the night 

Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true) 
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh 

In the corner of the valley, we took him by surprise 
The sound of steel rang loud, above the battle cries 
I found her lying lifeless, dagger through her heart 
I picked her up, and held her high, and I swore to be avenged 
Swore to the best, oh swore to be avenged, oh 

Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love was true) 
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh 

Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true (our love) 
Screaming in the night, fighting for my life, I'd die for you, oh 
I knew it all along, headed for the sun, our love was true, oh
