Woe is me
I'm as blue as any one can be
I feel like a weepin' willow tree
I'm in a cryin' mood

Pair by pair
I see happy lovers everywhere
But the one I love don't seem to care
I'm in a cryin' mood

Each day I'm by my own-some
Blue Mondays rain or shine
I'll say this world is lonesome
I'm just a lonesome fine (?)

Why oh why
Did he have to go and say good-bye?
Seems the moon is low and so am I
I'm in a cryin' mood

Each day I'm by my own-some
Blue Mondays rain or shine
I'll say this world is lonesome
I'm just a lonesome fine (?)

Oh why oh why
Did he have to go and say good-bye?
Seems the moon is low and so am I
I'm in a cryin' mood
