When my way growth drier precious Lord linger near when my life is almost gone
Hear my cry hear my call hold my hand last I fall
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand lead me on let me stand I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storm through the night lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home

When my work is all done and my race here is run
Let me see by the light Thou has shone
That there city's so bright with the Lamb as the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand...
