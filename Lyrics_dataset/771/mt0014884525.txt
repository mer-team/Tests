Sisters, Brothers And The Whities 
Blacks And The Crackers 
Police And Their Backers 
They're All Political Actors 

Hurry, People Running From Their Worries
While The Judge And His Juries 
Dictate The Law That's Partly Flaw. 
Cat Calling Love Balling Fussing And Cussing 

Top Billing Now Is Killing 
For Peace No One Is Willing 
Kind Of Make You Get That Feeling

Everybody Smoke 
Use The Pill And The Dope 
Educated Fools 
From-Uneducated Schools 

Pimping People Is The Rule 
Polluted Water In The Pool 

And Nixon Talking About Don't Worry 
He Says Don't Worry 
He Says Don't Worry 
He Says Don't Worry 

But They Don't Know There Can Be No Show 
And If There's A Hell Below We're All Gonna Go
Everybody's Praying And Everybody's Saying 
But When Come Time To Do 
Everybody's Laying 

Just Talking About Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry 

Sisters, Brothers And The Whitie
Blacks And The Crackers 
Stone Stone Junkie 
Police And Their Backers 
They're All Political Actors 

Smoke, The Pill And The Dope, 
Educated Fools From Uneducated Schools, 
Pimping People Is The Rule 
Polluted Water In The Pool

And Everybody's Saying Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry 
They Say Don't Worry

But They Don't Know 
There Can Be No Show 
If There's A Hell Below 
We're All Gonna Go 


Lord What We Gonna Do 
If Everything I Say Is True 
This Ain't No Way It Ought To Be
1f Only All The Mass Could See

But Everybody Keeps Saying Don't Worry
