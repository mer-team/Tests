(Oh least of all least of all you)
Who in all this world did I think would be untrue
Oh oh least of all least of all you
Who did I expect to laugh and tell me we were through
Oh oh least of all least of all you
You who was so understanding you who said to me
We would always be together through eternity
Who know but I love to see hurt the way I do
Oh oh least of all least of all you
You who was so understanding...
Oh oh least of all least of all you
