For this second of your life,
Tell me that its true,
Waiting for a sign,
That's all I want of you.
Your heart hides a secret
A promise of what is,
Something more than this.

Just a second of your time,
Any one will do,
Taste of any other,
Is all I want from you,
You offer me the world,
And how can I resist
Something more than this?

Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible,
Nothing as it seems
To see touch taste smell hear 
But never know if its real

For this second of your life
Tell me if its true
Anyway we are
Is all I want of you
Your lips lies a secret
A promise of a kiss
Something more than this

Just a second of your time
Any one will do
To know any other is all I want for you
Giving me the world
Now I can't resist
Something more than this

Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible
Nothing as it seems
Never really understand what anything means

Another second of my life
Not knowing if its true
Make believe in nothing
Is all I want of you 
Whisper me your secret
Whisper me your ears
Always something other
Something more than this...
