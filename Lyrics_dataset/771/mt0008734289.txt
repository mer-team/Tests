Ice god shakes the earth 
Destruction of the path 
Sinking deeper in the snow 
Eating bark with blackened hands 
Swollen fingers frozen jaw 
Warm teeth wrapped around my wrist 
Frostbite eating away at our limbs 
Slit the belly brontotherium 
Climb towards vermillion snowbank fall 
Station of the crosses prayer save all 
Chewing bone 
Euphoria 
Land and sky 
Shining skull 
Ice field blanket land 
Hunted beyond the fray 
No direction known 
Running with the band 
Provisions wearing thin 
Avalanche sweeps the land 
Starvation setting in 
Spilling all that's left 
Should've kept the fruits from virgin's vine 
Three-horned face 
Pillar of red 
Evil lives atop my crooked spine 
Rosebush current flow 
Carmine river go 
Solar storms erupt on the sun 
Ice fields blanket land 
Snow queen 
Hypothermia 
Ice lips 
Hallucination 
Ice field blanket land 
Hunted beyond the fray 
No direction known 
Running with the band 
Provisions wearing thin 
Avalanche sweeps the land 
Landscape ebb 'n' flow 
Think I felt the end of time 
Skulls aglow as crystal shines 
And starts to warm the empty climb
