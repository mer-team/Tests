Well
Be-bo a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby doll my baby doll my baby doll

Well she's the gal in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
She's the one that I know
She's the one that loves me so

Be-bop a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby doll my baby doll my baby doll

Let's rock!

Well now she's the one that's got that beat
She's the one with the flyin' feet
She's the one that bops around the store
She's the one that gets more more more

Be-bop a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby doll my baby doll my baby doll

Let's rock again now!

Well
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby
Be-bop a lula
I don't mean maybe
Be-bop a lula
She's my baby doll my baby doll my baby doll
