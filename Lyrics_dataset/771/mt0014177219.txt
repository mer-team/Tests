Tell em how to sell it
It's propaganda
Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I give me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
so feebly a mental disorder
where reality is highly distorted
psychosis weak in the mind
inclined is mitosis as we approach this
ever rentless quest for avengeance
while those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a bowl of cherry's,
a bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

It's propaganda
sell em to the innocent
aww yea they're buying it
Just Show em to rebuild again ( I think this part is a bit unclear)

I'm a maniac hard one to handle
you better comeback with more than a scandal
fucked over for the times I've been grateful
fucked over by the times I've been hateful
made the tracks and fuck you with your pussy mouth
come again friend now we got some action
on and on is a name that they gave me
and your misery came here to save me

It's propaganda
sell em to the innocent
aww yea they're buying it
Just Show em to rebuild again ( I think this part is a bit unclear)
It's propaganda
it's propaganda
sell em to the innocent
fck yea they're buying it
Just Show em to rebuild again ( I think this part is a bit unclear)

Fuck it!

Who is falling
and faded slowly
you don't know me
but I made you 6X

I made you 2X

who is falling

but I made you 2x

I made you 4x
