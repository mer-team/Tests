There I was with the old man
Stranded again so off I ran
A young world crashing around me
No possibilities of getting what I need
He looked at me and smiled
Said "No, no, no, no, no child."

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try
She roll back down
To the warm soft ground, laughing
She don't know why,
She don't know why
Dog and butterfly

Well I stumbled upon your secret place
Safe in the trees
You had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires
Frozen strangers stealing your fires
The message hit my mind
Only words that I could find

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try
And she roll back down
To the warm soft ground, laughing
To the sky, up to the sky
Dog and butterfly

We're getting older
The world's getting colder
For the life of me
I don't know the reason why
Maybe it's livin'
Making us give in
Hearts rolling in
Taken back on the tide
We're balanced together
Ocean upon the sky

Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
Just begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try
She roll back down
To the warm soft ground
With a little tear in her eye
She had to try, she had to try

Dog and butterfly
Yeah, up in the air he liked to fly
The dog and butterfly
Below she had to try
She rolled back down
To the warm soft ground, laughing
She don't know why
But she had to try, she had to try
Dog and butterfly
