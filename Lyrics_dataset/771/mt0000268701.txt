How gentle was the breeze 
That surrounded the way 
How loud the sea's roar 
On the four winds everyday 
Sharing love, 
Wounded gifts from ancient long ago 
Together they closed in the circles we know 

Will we treasure all the secrets 
With lives changing scenes 
Where our hearts were warm with love 
So much love 

Will the flowers grow again 
As I open out my hand 
Precious time 
Time for healing 
The beauty of this land
The beauty of this land

How soulful those words 
That confuses the way 
How wild the mountains stare 
As they guard our everyday 
Take for granted noble hearts 
In the Golden Age that's flown 
Between us recall on 
A strong road we've known 

Will we treasure all the secrets 
With lives changing scenes 
Where our hearts were warm with love 
So much love 

Will the flowers grow again 
As I open out my hand 
Precious time 
Time for healing 
The beauty of this land.
