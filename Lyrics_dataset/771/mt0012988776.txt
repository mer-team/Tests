There's a devil in my body that I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me even though I love my wife
It's because I really love her I try to save her heart with love
But I know she knows I can see it in her eyes

I tried to stay at home love only her play with the kids and watch TV
But then my mind becomes unsure about the kind of love I need
My reasons for cheating there as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand and still stand by me
[ steel ]
It's so hard for me to call her I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night now I just want to go back home
She knows that I've lied Lord she'll cry where I can see
How much more can she stand and still stand by me
How much more can she stand and still stand by me
