I woke up early this morning 'round four a.m.
With the moon shining like flashlights on the interstate
Pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you lost yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's ok there's nothing left to say

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories 'cause I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
You'll think of me, you'll think of me
Take your cat, but leave my sweater
We have nothing left to weather
In fact I feel a hell of a lot better
You'll think of me, you'll think of me

Went out driving, trying to clear my head
Tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
Just a little tired of dealing with this
And all the baggage that still exists
Seems the only blessing that I have to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories 'cause I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
You'll think of me, you'll think of me
Take your cat, but leave my sweater
We have nothing left to weather
In fact I feel a hell of a lot better
You'll think of me, you'll think of me
