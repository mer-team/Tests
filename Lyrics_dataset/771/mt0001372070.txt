Your world was so different from mine don't you see
We just couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
And my world could never fit in wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happenes when two worlds collide
[ steel ]
Your world was made up...
