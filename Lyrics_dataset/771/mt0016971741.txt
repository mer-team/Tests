Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin it well

Here's the thing
I was minding my own business doin what I do
I wasn't tryina look for anything
All of a sudden couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze
Sayin 'what the hell'
Here's my name, number
Baby just hit my cell
Loving everything you do
Cuz you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinkin

You ain't even tryina play me boy
Cuz you're so good, and you're so fine
Got me sayin crazy things, listen

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin it well

Let me tell you how its gonna go
You and me, gonna need a little privacy
Don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
I need a one woman man 7 days a week
Quit tryina play it cool
Boy make your move
I told you how it is
Nothin to lose
You been starin over here all night for free
And I ain't takin no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me boy

You ain't even tryina play me boy
Cuz you're so good, and you're so fine.

Got me sayin crazy things, listen

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin it well

I ain't ever met a man like that
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin it well
