I'm always wanting more
Anything I haven't got
Everything I want it all
I just can't stop

Planning all my days away
Never find new ways to stay
Never feel enough today
Tomorrow must be more

More drink, more dreams
More bed, more drugs
More lust, more lies
More hate, more love

More fear, more fun
More pain, more flesh
More stars, more smiles
More fame, more sex

However hard I want
I know deep down inside
I'll never really get
More hope or any more time
Any more time
Any more time
Any more time

I want the sky to fall in
I want lightning and thunder
I want fire instead of rain
I want the world to make me wonder
Want to walk on water
Take a trip to the moon
Oh, give me all this
And give me it soon

More drink, more dreams, more drugs
More lust, more lies, more love

However hard I want
I know deep down inside
I'll never really get
More hope or any more time
Any more time
Any more time
Any more time
