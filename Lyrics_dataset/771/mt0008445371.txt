You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see
Your everything i hoped for
Your everything i need
You are so beautiful to me

Such joy and happiness you bring
Such joy and happiness you bring
Like a dream
A guiding light that shines in the night
Heavens gift to me
You are so beautiful to me
