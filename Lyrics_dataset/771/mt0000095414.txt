The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait... for the night
I wait... for the night
I see the waves passing... by the sea
I see the waves passing... by the sea

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I wait... for the night
I wait... for the night
I see the stars shouting your name... through the air
I see the stars shouting your name... through the air

The hours of the day
The hours of the day
I close... my eyes
I close... my eyes
[2x]
I go by the fields asking... where are you?
I go by the fields asking... where are you?

Where are you?... Where are you?... Where are you?... Where are you?
