I walk along the street of sorrow 
The boulevard of broken dreams 
Where Gigolo and Gigolette 
Can take a kiss without regret 
And so forget their broken dreams.

You laugh today and cry tomorrow 
When you behold your shattered schemes 
And Gigolo and Gigolette wake up to find
Their eyes are wet with tears that tell of
Broken dreams.

"Here is where you'll always find me 
Always walking up and down 
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town "

The joy that you find here, you borrow 
You cannot keep it long it seems 
But Gigolo and Gigolette 
Still sing a song and dance along 
The boulevard of broken dreams.
