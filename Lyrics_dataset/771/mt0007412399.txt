Sally, you opened out your arms to all those young men.
And girl you had room,
For every one of them.

You're the only girl.
Who are the only girl on Barry and Third
Sure as hell,
You're the only one who cares.

So put your hands together for Sally.
She saved all those young men.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She the one who cared for them.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen,
Zoot suit and shiny shoes.
He ran around town and threw his metholated laughter.
Most of his memories drowned.

But he remembers what his mother used to shout.
She used to shout,
"One day, surely son,
The street are gonna tire you out."

So put your hands together for Sally.
She's the one who cared for him.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She was there when his luck was running thin.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.

Tommy had a wife and family,
But the needle came between the love and the hard times.
Thank God for Sally,
She was there through the misery.

Just a place to lay his head.
Just about better off than dead.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day...

Vince, came up from the country.
Couldn't even find himself a room.
Thinking about his babies.
They're further away than the moon.

With no money but his pride in his pocket.
There's really no way he can go home.
There's a picture of his woman in his locket.
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone.

So put your hands together for Sally.
She's the one who cared for him.
Put your hands together for Sally.
She was there when his luck was running thin.

She's doing our dirty work.
She's the only one who can.
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world,
One angry day in New York.
