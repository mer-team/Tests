Hippolyte, Hippolyte Lamartine
Handiest Frenchman in the Caribbean
Got the Gull Reef Club sparkling and clean
Bravo bon travou Mr. Martine

Who patch the hole in the cistern wall
Hippolyte
Who solved my problems one and all
Hippolyte
A genie in a bottle twenty feet tall
Hippolyte, Hippolyte Lamartine

How come mine host is sitting pretty
A cistern full of water and shekels in the kitty
A million miles away from nasty New York City

Hippolyte, Hippolyte Lamartine
Hippolyte, Hippolyte Lamartine
Hippolyte, Hippolyte Lamartine

Get back to work
Or he'll chop you like sardines
Merci Hippolyte
Lamartine
