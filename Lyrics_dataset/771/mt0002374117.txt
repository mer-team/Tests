Your mother's voice was bleeding through the ceiling
As we rolled around along the kitchen floor
We could see your father in the backyard kneeling
Funny your mother doens't kneel much anymore
But I pushed myself right through you for the first time
And I told you that I'd never be untrue
And I held you like I never had before

Sister found the pills now for the first time
We all loved her more by her hospital bed
Father had a seat upon the right side
As Mother loved her dearly from her left
Then her heart had burst into a sea of softness
And it swallowed up the whole world all at once

We were closer than we'd ever been before
We were younger than we'd ever been before
Somehow safer than we'd ever been before
