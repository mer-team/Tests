Because I grab the microphone and I pick it up 
And then I fuck it up and then I turn it in 
And then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound 
And then you know I'm gonna get down and 
Eat a Scooby snack and take disco nap 
Because I'm shopping at sears, 'cause I don't buy at the gap 
Sending this one out to all the funky inspirations 
Pretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations 
Well, I'm working on rhymes, they're coming line by line 
Trying to put what I feel into word and rhymes 
I've got a feeling coming on, I've got to make some shit 
A little something stupid, for the twisted and sick 
Because I drive like a maniac on the streets 
And I don't give fuck 'cause I've got the beats 
Got my nuts swingin' from left to right and 
Right to left and I'm death defying 

I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak 
Here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back 
I try to be myself but I lose track 
Cause the shit gets complicated now I've got to get back 
As we learn to breed love for one another 
In these times of melding cultures 
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent 
I know this music comes down from African descent 
Because I don't need a magic potion 
Let me talk about back field in motion 
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I'm happy 
You know I'm a sneak like my old grand pappy 
I gotta give thanks to my man Archie Shepp 
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step 
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am 
And I talk to the people like Les McCann 

I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak 
Here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back 
I try to be myself but I lose track 
Cause the shit gets complicated now I've got to get back 
As we learn to breed love for one another 
In these times of melding cultures 
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent 
I know this music comes down from African descent 
Because I don't need a magic potion 
Let me talk about back field in motion 
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I'm happy 
You know I'm a sneak like my old grand pappy 
I gotta give thanks to my man Archie Shepp 
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step 
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am 
And I talk to the people like Les McCann 

I ask god for a rhyme or two 
A little something for the wise as well as the fool 
A little something to affect a little taste of change 
For the together and the strong as well as the deranged 
I'll do you right like bobby knight 
And then I'm rapping on the mic to the Broadway light 
Stomp my hands, I clap my feet and 
I'm bugging off Yusef Lateef 
I got a match to my ass and I'm a keep it lit 
I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt 
I'm rushing around town taking care of my functions 
Always got one more thing so forget about function 
We create this world and the problems go on 
Create our lives and the things that go wrong 
So to the deaf, the blind, look around and listen 
To what it is you want and for what you're wishing 

I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak 
Here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back 
I try to be myself but I lose track 
Cause the shit gets complicated now I've got to get back 
As we learn to breed love for one another 
In these times of melding cultures 
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent 
I know this music comes down from African descent 
Because I don't need a magic potion 
Let me talk about back field in motion 
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I'm happy 
You know I'm a sneak like my old grand pappy 
I gotta give thanks to my man Archie Shepp 
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step 
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am 
And I talk to the people like Les McCann
