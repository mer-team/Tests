Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta
Two men and four ponies on a long, lonesome ride
To see the high country and learn of her people
The ways that they live there, the ways that they die
One is a teacher, and one a beginner
Just wanting to be there, wanting to know

And together they're trying to tell us a story
That should have been listened to long, long ago
How the life in the mountains is living in danger
From too many people, too many machines
And the time is upon us, today is forever
Tomorrow is just one of yesterdays dreams
 
Cold nights in Canada and icy blue winds
The man and the mountains are brothers again
Clear waters are laughing, they sing to the skies
The Rockies are living, they never will die
Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta
Two men and four ponies on a long, lonesome ride.
