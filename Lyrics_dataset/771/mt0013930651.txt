Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, Batman smells,
Robin laid an egg
Batmobile lost its wheel
And Joker got away

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And there we got upsot.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

[Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
One-horse open sleigh.

What fun it is to love and sing
Ha ha ha
What fun it is to love and sing
Singin' song tonight
