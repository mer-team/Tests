I watched her sleep from the driver's seat
And she turned into an ocean spitting fish into my sea
Oh how she flickered to remain so young and innocently sweet
And how the sevrets in her belly wrestle softly for her keeping

Like the ring that left her finger green
And like the knife that set her shivering body free
Or like the knot she tied to so sweetly around me
We were aware of our boundaries
Someday I'll meet you on a telephone wire
Won't have to love you through a prayer
I can just touch you with my eyes and
We will talk about the world just as if we were still alive
And you will rest within my feathers
And I will have you for the keeping

And you will fly
so sweetly
around me
And you'll teach me to fly
So sweetly
Around you
And you will fly
so sweetly
around me
And you'll teach me to fly
so sweetly
around you

And if you talk to Jesus
Ask him if he wants me to come home
And if he says he's seen us changing all his plans to suit our own
Will you apologize and stand behind the selfish moves we've made
While learning life is strange
And people change then circle around again
