As far as all my friends can tell 
I took her leavin' well - that's kinda right
'Cause when I'm out with them 
I don't let her memory rule the night
For the most part I'm okay
But I still miss her in a round about way

Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down
'Cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks 
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
 
I no longer sit alone for hours by the phone
Wishin' she would call 
And just the other day 
I took her smilin' face down off my wall
I've come a long long way
But I still miss her in a round about way

Around about the time that midnight rolls around
That's around about the time my tears start falling down 
'Cause she's not around
I come unwound and my heart breaks
Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way

Yeah, I still miss her in a round about way
