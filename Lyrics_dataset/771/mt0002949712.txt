Born from dust
In the gutters of this earth
Maggots and leppers
Is this hell or is this heaven?
The cursed, the damned
Spreading hate across the land
No more pretending
Destroy your seeds of envy

Unleash the wicked
This hate is self-inflikted
Deliver this torment
Upon your final judgement
Follow the storm
In the land of no return
It’s you, the scum
We’ll kill until it’s done

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked
Falling and burning
Execution now is coming
Corruption is the sign
And destruction of your lies

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Inflikted
Show no mercy
Muthafuckin’ wicked

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt…
