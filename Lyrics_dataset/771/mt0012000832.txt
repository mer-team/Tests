Door peep shall not enter this a holy land
Where wise and true man stand 
sipping from this cupful cup of peace
Not one shall enter
Not one

Door people shall not enter
This a holy land
Where wise and true man stand
Sipping from the cup of peace
We chant down a babylon
We chant down a babylon
We chant down a babylon
Chant down a babylon

Give thanks and praise
Give thanks and praise
Give thanks and praise
You give thanks and praise
To the holy man of creation

You chant down a babylon
Chant down a babylon
We chant down a babylon
Chant down a babylon

Give thanks and praise
Give thanks and praise
Give thanks and praise
Give thanks and praise
To the holy man of creation

Door peep shall not enter
This a holy land
Where wise and true man stand
Sipping from the cup of peace
We chant down a babylon
We chant down a babylon
We chant down a babylon
Chant down a babylon
