Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I want to dance with my baby

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my Acid Rock

Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never want to stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music

Music makes the people come together
[Never gonna stop]
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Never gonna stop]

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie, uh, uh
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday

Music makes the people come together
[Never gonna stop]
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Never gonna stop]

Hey Mister D.J.

[Never want to stop]

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my Acid Rock

Hey Mister D.J.
Put a record on
I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never want to stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Uh, uh, uh

Music makes the people come together
[Never gonna stop]
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Never gonna stop]

Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like to boogie-woogie
Do you like my acid rock
(repeat and fade)
