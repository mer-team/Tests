If you're tellin' me I'm not on fire
You're just preachin' to the choir
I've gotten dull as old barbed wire from livin'
Last night I watched the evening news
It was the same ol' nothin' new
It should have cut me right in two
But it didn't
I don't know why it didn't

But I wanna feel somethin'
Somethin' that's a real somethin'
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
I wanna heart that beats and bleeds
A heart that's bustin' at the seams
I wanna care, I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I just wanna feel somethin'

If you're tellin' me that's just how it is
I don't buy it 'cause once I was kissed
By a red-headed girl with cherry lips
On her porch when I was sixteen
And I felt it somewhere in my soul, and time stood still, and I couldn't let go
I can't tell you 'cause I don't know how I got so cold
When did I get so cold?

I just wanna feel somethin'
Somethin' that's a real somethin'
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
Run my fingers through your fingers
Across your face and through your hair
And close my eyes and breathe you in like air
I just wanna feel somethin'

I hate that I'm jaded and I make you cry
But still you stick around me, only God knows why
Damn it all to hell, I'm done
'Cause I don't like what I've become
So come here, baby
Come here, baby

I just wanna feel somethin'
Somethin' that's a real somethin'
That moves me, that proves to me I'm still alive
Run my fingers through your fingers
Across your face and through your hair
And close my eyes and breathe you in like air
I just wanna feel somethin'

Come here, baby
