I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me
me

Fear
A Contradiction
Co-exist as darkness brought to life
My own skin don't seem to fit me right

Pain is my way of self-expression
A Fatal choice that always hangs above
Love what I kill Kill what I love

I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it from me

The one whose giant steps ahead of where you've been
What you don't see

I know I'll never save myself
Dying from this immortality

This is not an exit
I can't never change it
This is not an exit
There's now way out

Add a touch of
Who'd thought humanity's a dream
Things are not what they seem

Hungry for you but not to hurt you
Hunger for the secret of your life
I'm a timeless clock
and you kill time

I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it
I run you run you stop and then you take it
I run you run you stop and then you get it from me

This is not an exit
I can't never change it
This is not an exit
There's now way out

I know I'll never be free
Change doesn't come easy
And if I'll never be free
You'll live in hell with me

This is not an exit

I can't ever change it
You stop and then you take it
I stop but I can't fake it
Cause this is not an exit

Pain is my way of self-expression
a fatal choice hangs above 
Love what I kill kill what I love

Love

This is not an exit
I can't ever change it
Cause this is not an exit
Hand over fist come and taste my dark trick
Hand over fist I'll kill you when I give it

This is not an exit
I can't ever change it
Cause this is not an exit

Be dangerous and unpredictable
and make a lot of noise
