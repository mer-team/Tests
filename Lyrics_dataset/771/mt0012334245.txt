I see you, you see me
Watch you blowin the lines when youre making a scene
Oh girl, youve got to know
What my head overlooks
The senses will show to my heart
When its watching for lies
You cant escape my
Private eyes
Theyre watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
Theyre watching you
Private eyes
Theyre watching you watching you watching you watching you

You play with words you play with love
You can twist it around baby that aint enough
Cause girl Im gonna know
If youre letting me in or letting me go
Dont lie when youre hurting inside
cause you cant escape my
Private eyes
Theyre watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
Theyre watching you
Private eyes
Theyre watching you watching you watching you watching you

Why you try to put up a front for me
Im a spy but on your side you see
Slip on, into any disguise
Ill still know you
Look into my private eyes
