Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin' ev'rybody's in a play 
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day hey,hey

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city 
On the streets where once was pity 
Mister blue sky is living here today hey, hey

Mister blue sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration, mister blue sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for 

Hey there mister blue 
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Ev'rybody smiles at you

Mister blue sky, mister blue sky
Mister blue sky

Mister blue, you did it right 
But soon comes mister night creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this 
I'll remember you this way 

Mister blue sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there mister blue 
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Ev'rybody smiles at you
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
