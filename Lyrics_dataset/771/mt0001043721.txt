Intro: RZA 



[Tiger style] 

[Tiger style] Tiger style 

Yo, huh, huh 

Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit 

Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit 

Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuttin Ta Fuck Wit 

There's noplace to hide once I step inside the room 

Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom 

BAM! Aw, MAN! I SLAM 

JAM, that's freedom like Tarzan 



Verse One: RZA 



I be tossin, enforcin, my style is awesome 

I'm causin more Family Feud's than Richard Dawson 

And the survey said -- ya dead 

Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin head 

MZA who was that? Aiyyo, the Wu is back 

Makin niggaz go BO BO!, like on Super Cat 

Me fear no-one, oh no, here come 

The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum! 



Verse Two: Inspector Deck 



I puts the needle to the groove, I gets rude 

And I'm forced to fuck it up 

My style carries like a pickup truck 

Across the clear blue yonder 

Seek the China Sea, I slam tracks like quarterbacks sacks from L.T. 

Now why try and test, the Rebel INS? 

Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best 

Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake 

And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state! 



Chorus: RZA 



And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus 

Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with 

Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted 

Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with 



Interlude: RZA 



Hyah! 

Step up, boy! 

Represent! 

Chop his head off, kid! 



Verse Three: Method Man 



The Meth will come out tomorrow, 

Styles, is wild, berserk, bizarro 

Flow, with more afro than Rollo 

Comin to a fork in the road which way to go just follow 

Method, the Legend, niggaz is Sleepy Hollow 

In fact I'm a hard act to follow 

I dealt for dolo 

Bogart comin on through 

Niggaz is like "Oh, my God, not you!" 

Yes, I, Come to get a slice of the punk and the pie 

Rather do than die, check my 

Flava, comin from the RZA 

Which is short for the razor 

Who make me reminisce true like Deja 

Vu! I'm rubber, niggaz is like glue 

Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you 



[Chorus & shout outs]
