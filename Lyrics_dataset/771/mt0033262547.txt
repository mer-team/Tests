Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River,
Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Blowin' like the breeze
 
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
 
All my memories gathered 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrops in my eye
 
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
 
I hear her voice
In the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
 
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain momma
Take me home, country roads
 
Take me home, now country roads
Take me home, now country roads
