You are no God to me
You are nothing to me
This is the reckoning

Enjoy this while it lasts
It won't be long before it dies

You've stolen lives, and broken dreams
No man can be a guillotine 

You are no God to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is the reckoning

Was the penance not enough?
Was the strength not enough?
No man can be a guillotine 

You are no God to me
This is a reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is the reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no God to me
There is the reckoning

The betrayed, will now see the truth
And the broken-hearted, will finally yell
You will be judged
You will be found wanting
And we'll be there to see you fall

You are no God to me
This is the reckoning
You are nothing to me
This is the reckoning
And I will be there
To see you fall
You are no God to me
There is the reckoning
