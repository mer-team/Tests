Just one voice 
Singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Singing so they hear what's on your mind
And when you look around you'll find 
There's more than

One voice
Singing in the darkness
Joining with your one voice
Each and every note another rock
And hands are joined and fears unlock

If only one voice
Would start it  on it's own
You need just one voice
Facing the unknown
And then that one voice
Would never be alone
It takes that one voice

Pa pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa 

It takes that one voice
Just one voice
Singing in the darkness
All it takes just one voice
Shout it out and let it ring
Just one voice
It takes that one voice
And everyone will sing
