Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars,
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars.
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars,
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars.
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars,
Ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars.

Once again, I find myself with my friends,
Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends. 
Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box,
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes.
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling,
Mashing to the music, I can do anything.
Freaky Dicky star speckles and pink butterflies and life is nice, so nice,
I walk into a club and I've found paradise, I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes.

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ,
Lover dance all night to this DJ.

Like the record spins on the trails we blaze, the walls are closing in but that's okay,
Because I've been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good. 
I'm on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighborhood,
So let me be your star for one night that's right.
Sweat box, laser beams, flashing lights, you've got to feel the rush,
Feel the spice of life, love life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise.
Icing, mesmerizing, the minds are sick ones, cause what we are is victims of fun,
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun; come on the fun is just begun.

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ,
Lover dance all night to this DJ.

It goes ooh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars,
Oh la la, I see stars, I'm seeing stars.

Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ,
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ.
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise,
Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ.
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ,
Lover dance all night to this DJ.
