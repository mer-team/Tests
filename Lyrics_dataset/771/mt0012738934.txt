So fucking what!

Well I've been to Hastings
And I've been to Brighton

Well who cares, who cares what you do
Who cares, who cares about you
You, you, you

Well I've sucked sweets
And I've sucked rock
And I've even sucked an old man's cock

Well I've fucked a sheep
And I've fucked a goat

So what, so what
So what, so what you boring little cunt
Well who cares, who cares what you do
Who cares, who cares about you
You, you, you, you

Well who cares, who cares what you do
Who cares, who cares about you

And I've had the pox and that ain't nice

And I've even fucked a schoolgirl's crack
So what, so what
So what, so what you boring little cunt
Who cares, who cares about you
Who cares, who cares about you
You, you, you, you....
