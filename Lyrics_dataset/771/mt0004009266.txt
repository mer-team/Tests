(Steven Curtis Chapman)
So here we are we're standing face to face
And yet we seem to be a million miles apart
This world can feel like such a lonely place
It all depends on what you see from where you are

So please,
Please tell me what you can
Cause I wanna understand

How does it look from your side?
How does it look from where you are?
How does it look from your side?
From your side of the world

So tell me the color of your sky above
Paint me a picture of the things that make you smile
Show me your fears, and what you're dreaming of
Take me to where my heart can see across the miles

And please
Please tell me what you can
Cause I want to understand

How does it look from your side?
How does it look from where you are?
How does it look from your side?
From your side of the world

Your side of the world
Don't be surprised to find it not too far away
Cause what we are both in search of
Is one in the same

So please
Please tell me what you see
Cause I really want to be
The one who understands

How does it look from your side?

How does it look from your side?
How does it look from where you are?
How does it look from your side?
From your side of the world
