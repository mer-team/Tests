I'm so weary and all alone
Feel tired like heavy stone
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Who will see and who will care
Bout this load that I must bear
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Prayers are said to heaven above
'bout my burdens,woes and love

Head bowed down with misery
Nothing now appeals to me
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

Give me just another day
There's one thing I want to say
Friends are well when all is gold
Leave you always when you're old
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
