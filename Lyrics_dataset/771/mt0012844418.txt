I wonder what she'll think about me leaving
I wonder if she'll even know I'm gone

I wonder what she'll think about my leaving
Wish I could be there hidden if she cries
Cause leaving really won't be worth my trouble
If I can't see the teardrops fill her eyes

Wish I could be there standing by her window
When she finds the note about me being gone
I'm almost sure her coldness never changes
But still I'd like to know it if I'm wrong

I wonder what she'll think about me leaving
I'd like to see her standing all alone
If she hurts at all I'd like to know it happened
I wonder if she'll even know I'm gone
I wonder if she'll notice that I'm gone
