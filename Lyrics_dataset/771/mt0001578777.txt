Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the night before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding - cannot stand the strain

With each new mile		They death defy me
Standing on trial		Scrutinize me
				And questionize my
				Strong denial
  
Bullet bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Windows illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Freefall as I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies

Changing my course		Blurred and scorched
Breathing exhaust		As we distort
				By gravity
				Of such G-force

Bullet bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Freefall but never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within

Wanting much more		I implore you
Near to death's door		To ignore
				The screams of all
				Who fall before

Bullet bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Bullet bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain

Bullet
