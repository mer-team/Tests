Come fly, fasten seatbelts before we land
give it all up to the custom man
before we can leave we must go thru again
come ride the runaway with me.

fly high engines buzzin' and head in my hands
as long as they buzz then we can relax
pick up the bags and light up our flags
come ride the runaway with me.
