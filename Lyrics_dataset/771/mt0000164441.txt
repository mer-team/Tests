My latest sun is sinking fast, 
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past 
My triumph is begun

   O come, angel band come and around me stand
   O bear me away on your snowy wings to my immortal home
   O bear me away on your snowy wings to my immortal home

I know I'm nearing holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear
I brush the dew of Jordan's banks
The crossing must be near

I've almost gained my heav'nly home
My spirit loudly sings
The holy ones behold they come
I hear the noise of wings

O bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory
