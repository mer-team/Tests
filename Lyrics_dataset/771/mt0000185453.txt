Once I loved
And I gave so much to this love
You were the world to me
Once I cried
At the thought I was foolish and proud
And let you say goodbye
 
Then one day
From my infinite sadness you came
And brought me love again
Now I know
That no matter what ever be falls
I'll never say goodbye

I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away
