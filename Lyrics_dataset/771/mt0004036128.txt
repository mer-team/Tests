after all this work she's still built to sail
the curve of the whole coast her curve's the whole coast
how she could read the map showing only the sea
only empty houses (empty houses)
are we still able, at night to watch
with human heart's at all (x2)
how she could read the map showing only the bells (x2)
she's still able, at night to watch
with a human heart (x2)
not just a ghost's heart (x4)
