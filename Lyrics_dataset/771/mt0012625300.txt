Enemy - show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you!
Readily - either way it better be
Dont you fuckin' pity me
Get up, get off...

What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball!

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin down, this is a war!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
Youre' leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press you face against the glass - suffer

I've just begun
Its about that time
Gotta get mine

You can't kill me
Cuz I'm already
Inside you

SICK
