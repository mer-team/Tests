Time has come between us:
in the passing months I've felt you slip away
as your words and mine came like nursery rhymes
till there was nothing left to say.

Distance came between us long ago,
as our memories faded away...
over the miles I ceased to smile
because nothing felt the same.

That's how it seemed a week ago,
far off in time and space.

Time and distance are between us now,
they form a bond to make things sure.
Nothing ever shatters,
you know what happens:
time and distance make a love secure.
