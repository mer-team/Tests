Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be.
Say you, say me, say it together, naturally.

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park, playing games in the dark.
And what they played was a masquerade,
But from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be.
Say you, say me, say it together naturally.

As we go down life's lonesome highway,
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two.
That helping hand, someone who understands,
And when you feel you've lost your way,
You've got someone there to say: I'll show you!

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be.
Say you, say me, say it together naturally.

So you thin you know the answer - oh no.
Well, the whole world's got you dancing, that's right, I'm telling you.
It's time to start believe, oh yes,
Believe in who you are, you are a shining star.

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be.
Say you, say me, say it together naturally. 

Say it together naturally.
Say it together... Naturally.
