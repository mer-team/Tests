You're the whisper of a summer breeze
You're the kiss that puts my soul at ease
What I'm sayin' is I'm into you
Here's my story, and the story goes
You give love
You get love
And more than heaven knows
You're gonna see

I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover, come to me
Rush, rush
I want to see, I want to see you free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Oh, what you do to me

And all I ask of you is what you are
And even if you're right next to me
It's still too far away
If I'm not inside your arms
I get traumatic, baby, yes I know
But I need you
I want you
Oh, man, I love you so
You're gonna see

I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover, come to me
Rush, rush
I want to see, I want to see you free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Oh, what you do to me

When you kiss me up and down
Turn my senses all around
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I don't know just how or why
But no one else has touched me so deep, so deep
So deep inside

Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Have you ever been in love?
No.
Neither have I. 
Isn't that terrible.
No. 
I just reminds us that we're all alone.

I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh, baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover, come to me
Rush, rush
I want to see, I want to see you free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Oh, what you do to me

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover, come to me
Rush, rush
I want to see, I want to see you free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Oh, what you do to me
