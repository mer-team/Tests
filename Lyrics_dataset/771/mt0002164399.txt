There was a woman in the bible days
She had been sick, sick so very long
When she heard that Jesus was passing by
So she joined the gathering throng
And while she was pushing her way through
Someone ask her what are you trying to do
She said if I would just touch the hem of his garment
I know I'll be made whole

She cried: Oh Lord, Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Shed said if I could just touch the hem of his garment
I know I'll be made whole soon

She spend her money here and there
Until she had no, had no more to spare
The doctors they done all that they could
But their medicine could do no good
When she touched him, the savior didn't see
But still he turned around and cried
Somebody touched me
She said it was I who just wanna touch
the Hem of your garment
I know I'll made whole right now
