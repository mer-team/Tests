Once in a lifetime
You'll open up your heart
Maybe once in your lifetime
You'll swear to never be apart
You think your love's on solid ground
Then out the blue, it all comes tumbling down 

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feeling lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me 
Somebody help me understand

And my picture
In your locket
What will you do with it now
All our friends
And our memories
Tell me how we sort them out
What's yours is yours
What's mine is mine 
Is that all that's left
After all this time

Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feeling lonely
Who's gonna show me the light
Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
How can love just stop
Tell me 
Somebody help me understand

Help me understand
Why I'm not part of your plan
And you don't need me anymore
Help me understand
Why I still want to be where you are
Even though I know in my heart
You don't love me anymore
