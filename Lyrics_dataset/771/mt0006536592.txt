Ooh, somethin's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a lover on fire
Hold me tight, babe
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can
Make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
(No, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

It surrounds me
Over me like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
You're on my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll
Make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
(No, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

I think I'm in love
Oh no, no, no

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
(No, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

Baby, how you do it
There must be somethin' to it
Babe, I know it's gotta be love
{Oh, with magic in your hand)
You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love

It's gotta be love
(Love) and my life's lookin' up
(Love)
