The ants are in the sugar
The muscles atrophied
We're on the other side, the screen is us and we're t.v.
Spread me open, sticking to my bony ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
I was born into this
Everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved
Is the man that you fear

Pray untill you're number
Asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting
Tomorrow's turned up dead

I have it all and I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay and you will see
You can kill yourself now
Because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved
Is the monster you fear

Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all your children
To camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals
Pray now baby
Pray your life was just a dream

(I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape)

Pinch the head off
Collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far
I was born into this
Everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved
Is the man that you fear

Peel off all those eyes
Crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all your children
To camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters
Pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream
The cut that never heals

Pray now baby
Pray your life was just a dream
The world in my hands
There's no one left to hear you scream
There's no one left for you
(When all of your wishes are granted
Many of your dreams will be destroyed)
