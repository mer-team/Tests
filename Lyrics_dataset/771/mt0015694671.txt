Girl, when I look at you
You look through me like I'm not even there
I'm trying not to give up
To be strong but I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place your heart is hiding
And I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free...
Don't make me

What if when I'm long gone it dawns on you, you just might want me back?
Let me make myself clear
If I leave here its done, I'm gone, that's that

You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it?

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
