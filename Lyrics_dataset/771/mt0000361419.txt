With the sunlight through
Departed into darkness
I need someone too
A fantasy and you

Now is here
Here is now
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
You inspire 
Me somehow
Nah-na-na-nah-nah

With the words like air
A destiny we shared
Is a dream come true
A fantasy and you

Now is here
Here is now
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
You inspire 
Me somehow
Nah-na-na-nah-nah
