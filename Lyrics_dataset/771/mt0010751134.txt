Thru the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Somehow thru the day I don't give in
I hide the tears  that wait until
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again

Why did you go   why did you go
Don't you know  don't you know   I need you
