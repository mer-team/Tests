Wake up, Charlie, rise and shine.
Pour the tea, I'll draw the blinds,
Sunlight halo, you look wonderful,
Darling, Charlie, pale and deathly still,
For heavens shake wake up Charlie.

Was a full moon last night, I was full of bravado.
Dead drunk, dead sure one of us had to go.
Raised my hand in anger, hurt you again.
Dust to dust and fire to ashes, you can
Thank me for nothing now, Charlie.

I was eaten up with jealousy,
Bones to pick and rumours to feed,
How my heart bleeds, love's a big mistake,
Mercy, Charlie, oh for pity's sake,
Forgive me, speak to me, Charlie.

Wake up, Charlie, rise and shine.
Pour the tea, I'll draw the blinds,
Sunlight halo, you look wonderful,
Darling, Charlie, pale and deathly still,
For heavens shake wake up Charlie.
