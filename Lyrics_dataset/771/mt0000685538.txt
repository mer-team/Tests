Oh, let that jukebox keep on playin'
Let that record roll around
Let my baby keep on sayin'
She's a lonesome gal in town
Let 'er know that I'll be waitin'
When my lonely days are through
Let the jukebox keep on playin'
Till I'm holdin' you

Oh, let those honky-tonkin' angels
Be the girls I never loved
Let 'em know its you I'm cravin'
It's you I'm dreamin' of
Let 'em know that I'll be waitin'
When my lonely days are through
let the jukebox keep on playin'
Till I'm holdin' you

Oh, let that jukebox keep on playin'
Let that record roll around
Let my baby keep on sayin'
She's a lonesome gal in town
Let 'er know that I'll be waitin'
When my lonely days are through
Let the jukebox keep on playin'
Till I'm holdin' you
