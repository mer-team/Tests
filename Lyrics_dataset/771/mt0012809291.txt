I saw her and told myself she was my dream come true
Let my eyes decieve me from the start
They told me I wanted her more than I wanted you
Guess my eyes were bigger than my heart

Wasn't I the foolish one Lord above what have I done
For her love I tore our world apart
Now she's here but it's no good I don't care the way I should
Guess my eyes were bigger than my heart

I allowed these eyes of mine to lead me into sin
Made me think that I could love her true
Now she stands out in the cold my heart won't let her in
There was only room enough for you
Wasn't I the foolish one...
