Archaic methods transfer
Through well in the face of mass denial.
Bitterness fuels the mode
For the escape of mediocrity.
Stepping the grate, shattered nerves
Ground down to a glass edge
Carrying me away.

Bloodletting a favorite game of solitaire.
A suicide mission destined to fail,
A moving ladder to climb taking me away.
I wouldn't have it any other way
