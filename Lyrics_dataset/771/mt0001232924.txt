The shame in his face
The price that he pays
The hopelesness in his eyes

The pain in his voice
There's no other choice
The hopelesness in his eyes

The sorrow he felt inside
There was no place to hide
It made him sad

The story he told me there
Out in the smoky air
It made me sad

Everyone needs a friend
Someone to take the hand
Someone to love

Then when he found support
Someone to draw the sword
Then he found love

Everyone need a friend...
