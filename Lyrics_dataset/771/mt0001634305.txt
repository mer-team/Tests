Always cast a pair of hose
spaces pressed together rose
arms around each others back
you know that i liked you Jack
and all the other boys who pose
a silent dance in the woods
in this love of bite that's shown
another can of coca cola
don't you ever call me Mom
freckled dancing in the plant
and air so thin I wanted time
as far as you can see it's fun
you're nothing but a history
a second here and then you're gone
quicksand quicksand all around
turn the corner just beyond
the shadows move and change the groove
and something tells me not to brood
turning round and that's a show
you're walking through my heart once more
don't forget to close the door
i'm not certain what you found
all the men want a charming word/whore
like a crown full of jewels
sunny skies and angels please
falling down upon my knees
that wasn't how its supposed to be
clear blue eyes, just as tries
the wind is busy blowing dizzy
you're dreams were shot like a star
exploding in a mind somewhere
doing something on a dare
pulling a trigger like breathing air
a sunkissed boy that gave no thought
to what he'd made while others saved
ocean spreads a candle said/candle's head
it's dripping in my hand, you're dead
little brother reminding me
moments take forever tree
you can see as far as sin
don't you know the shape i'm in
you're walking through my heart once more
don't forget to close the door
