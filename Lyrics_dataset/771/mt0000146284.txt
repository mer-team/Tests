Willingly I fell in love with you

Willingly I learned to love you too

Though we both knew that it was wrong to someone else we both belong

We fell in love willingly

Willingly I fell although I knew

Sweetheart I knew the same as you

So if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be then we'll wait willingly

I love you 
I love you too 

I want you 
and  I want you too

But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be then we'll wait willingly


But if it's fate for us to wait until our love can be then we'll wait willingly

Yes we'll wait willingly
