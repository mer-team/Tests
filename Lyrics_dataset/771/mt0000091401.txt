She go ooh woppa dodalada, ooh, ooh
She go ooh woppa dodalada, ooh, ooh

She comes strutting down the street
In her sophisticated style
The way she's dressed
Is knocking 'em wild

The cats started gazing
And they called her out
Her pink pedal pushers
Was knocking 'em out

She wears pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers have made her
The queen of them all

She goes driving down the street
In her brand new car
The cats start gazing
From near and far

She don't cause commotion
Till she steps outside
The boys get hep and holler
Ooh, ooh, man alive

She's wearing pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers have made her
The queen of them all

She go ooh....

She won the number one vote
At the high school prom
The older folks said
She kinda favored her mom

But she got more
Than mom's ever had
'Cause she's a rock and roll ditty
With a brand new fad

She's wearing pink pedal pushers
Her pink pedal pushers
Them pink pedal pushers have
Made her the queen of them all

You know they gave her a part
In a high school play
And they all chose her
To play the old may

Curtain call
They had a crowd overflow
Her pink pedal pushers
They stole the show

She wears pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers
Pink pedal pushers have made her
The queen of them all

Yeah, she goes, oooh....

Her pink pedal pushers have
Made her the queen of them all
