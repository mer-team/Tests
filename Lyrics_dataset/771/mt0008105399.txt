If I was jesus, I'd have some real long hair,
A robe and some sandals, exactly what i'd wear,
I'd be the guy at the party, turnin water to wine,
 yeah me and my desciples, we'd have a real good time

Ooooh and I'd lay my life down for you (whoah whoahao)
 Yeah I'd show you whos the boss (whoah whoahao)
  I'd forgive you and adore you, while I was hanging on your cross

If I was Jesus, I'd have some Friends that were poor,
 I'd run around with the wrong crowd, Man I'd never be bored,
 then I'd heal me a blind man, get myself crucified,
 by politicians and preachers who got somethin' to hide

Ooooh and I'd lay my life down for you (whoah whoahao)
 Yeah I'd show you whos the boss (whoah whoahao)
  I'd forgive you and adore you, while I was hanging on your cross

If I was Jesus.....

If I was Jesus, I'd come back from the dead, and I'd walk on some water, just to mess with your head, I'd know your dark little secrets, I'd look you right in the face and tell you I love you with amazing grace....

Ooooh and I'd lay my life down for you (whoah whoahao)
 Yeah I'd show you whos the boss (whoah whoahao)
  I'd forgive you and adore you, while I was hanging on your cross

If I was Jesus,........If I was Jesus
