I am standing on the Jordan
Gazing 'cross the swelling tide
There I'll rest my heavy burden
'Till all doubts and fears Lord subside

I can hear the angels singing
I can see, Lord, them 'round the throne
Well I can hear, I hear the saints, child, oh singing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah now, now 'tis done, oh yes

Tell me...
How far am I from Canaan? 2x
With the angels singing and the joybell ringing
And glory, Lord, How far am I from Canaan?

Lord, over there we'll shout, "Troubles over!" 2x

With the angels singing and the joybell ringing
And glory, Lord, How far am I from Canaan?
Lord, up there I'll need my mother
Lord, when I get on home, my savior I'll join
Well, I'll shout God knows I'm going to dwell
