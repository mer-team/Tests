Mexicali rose, stop crying 
I'll come back to you some sunny day
Every night you know that I'll be pineing
Every hour of year while you're away.
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear
Banish all those tears and please don't cry
Kiss me once again and hold me
Mexico rose, goodbye.
Mexicali rose, I'm leaving, don't feel blue
Mexicali rose, stop grieving, I love you
When the dove of love is winging through the blue
All the castles you've been building will come true.
Mexicali rose, stop crying 
I'll come back to you some sunny day
Every night you know that I'll be pineing
Every hour of year while you're away.
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear
Banish all those tears and please don't cry
Kiss me once again and hold me
Mexico rose, goodbye...
