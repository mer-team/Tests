Oh
Uh-huh

Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight, why do they say love is blind
Slow down, we dont have to move fast
Cause the love that is real is made to last

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later itll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Ooh...

We paint a picture walkin down the street
Leaves are fallin, baby, so are we
Hand in hand, thats the way it shoud be
How could somethin so easy make me feel so complete

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later itll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Take it easy, ooh
I want o feel your every emotion
Shh...dont talk
And well makin love in slow motion
Ooh...slow motion, baby
Ooh...slow motion, baby

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later itll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

One heartbeat at a time (Slow motion, baby)
One heartbeat (Oh, slow motion, baby)
Sooner or later itll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat

One heartbeat (Yeah)
One heartbeat (Ooh, baby)
Sooner or later itll all fall in love
If we take it one heartbeat
