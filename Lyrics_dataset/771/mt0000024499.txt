No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light,
(and the stage) And the stage my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? (oh-oh-oh)
Won't someone tell me?
Cause my (sweet life) life must be somewhere to be found
(must be somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (la la-la!),
Where the living is harder (la-la!).

Concrete jungle (la la-la!)
Man you got to do your (la la-la!) best. Whoa, yeah.
No chains around my feet,
But I'm not free, oh-ooh!
I know I am bound here in captivity;
G'yeah, now (never, never) I've never known happiness;
(never, never) I've never known what sweet caress is
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown;
Won't someone help me? 'Cause I (sweet life)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(must be somewhere for me), he-yeah!
In this a concrete jungle (la la-la!)
I said, what do you cry for me (la-la!) now, o-oh!
Concrete jungle (la la-la!), ah, won't you let me be (la la-la!), now.
Hey! Oh, now!

I said that life (sweet life) it must be somewhere to be found
(must be somewhere for me)
Oh, instead, concrete jungle (la-la!) collusion (la-la!)
Confusion (confusion). Eh!

Concrete jungle (la-la!) baby, you've got it in.
Concrete jungle (la la-la!), now. Eh!
Concrete jungle (la la-la!).

What do you stand for me (la-la!), now?
