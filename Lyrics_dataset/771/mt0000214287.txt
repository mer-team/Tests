High on a hilltop overlooking a city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream

High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray

I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you're silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil in you
