You said that I would be sorry
If you went away
You said I wouldn't be happy
Without hell to pay
You said the teardrops would fall
Between the bedroom walls
You said that I would regret
But it hasn't happened yet

Your friends come over and offer
To take me to eat
They seem so sorry I'm suffering
So much misery
They say to just give a call
Next time that I start to crawl
I always say yeah you bet
But it hasn't happened yet

I don't have anyone
I'm having fun
Nobody's into me
No one's a mystery
I see you on the street
My heart don't miss a beat
Love and hostility
Don't mean a thing to me

I find it hard to remember
The good times we had
Call me insensitive
Now that it's over, I'm glad
You said when big shadows fell
It would be too hard to tell
My life from your silhouette
But it hasn't happened yet

Don't hold your breath, baby
