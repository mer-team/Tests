There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected

They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turn up noses

Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached

She's a honey, she's a tramp 
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only got one chance
Beast and beauties, but they all can dance

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, give her to me
Wrap her up

Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven

You pretty babies, from Paris France
Crazy horses, love to dance

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only got one chance
Beast and beauties, but they all can dance

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, give her to me
Wrap her up

Give her to me, wrap her up
I'll take her home with me, wrap her up
She is all I need, wrap her up
I only got one chance, beast and beauties
But they all can dance

Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, give her to me
