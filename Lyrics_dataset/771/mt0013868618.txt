I'll probably never see you eye-to-eye again.
This letter's meant to be my last farewell.
But you need to understand, I'm nearly crazy.
You need to know my life has gone to hell.

Write me back and tell me why it ended.
I need some final proof to show my heart.
I'll be somewhere between I love you, and what you're feeling now.
Lookin' for a place to fall apart.

Looking for a place to fall apart.
Tryin' to find a place I can leave my heart.
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start,
Lookin' for a place to fall apart.

I can't seem to justify your leavin' me.
I'm bewildered as to how it all came down.
I thought everything was fine 'til your phone call
The call that turned my world around.

Hey, send me word and tell me why it ended.
I need some final proof to show my heart.
I'll be somewhere between I love you, and what you're feeling now.
Lookin' for a place to fall apart.

Looking for a place to fall apart.
Tryin' to find a place I can leave my heart.
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start,
Lookin' for a place to fall apart.

Looking for a place to fall apart.
Tryin' to find a place I can leave my heart.
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start,
Lookin' for a place to fall apart.
