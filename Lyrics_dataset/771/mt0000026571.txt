Till the end of time
long as stars are in the blue
long as there's a spring, a bird to sing
I'll go on loving you

Till the end of time
long as roses bloom in May
my love for you will go deeper
with every passing day

till the wells run dry 
and each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you to care for you
through laughter and through tears

so take my hand in sweet surrender
and tenderly say that I'm
the one you'll love and live
till the end of time.
