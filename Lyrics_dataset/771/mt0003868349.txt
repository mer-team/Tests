As simple as breathing
I picture your face,
All tangled in daydreams
And shielded with grace.

I feel you beside me.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart
Only for you.

If I must do without
I'll let these sparks fly out
Across the wilderness
From me to you.

As certain as sunrise
Your image unwinds.
You're clearer than crystal.
You fill up my mind.

Now I have you by my side.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart
Only for you.

Though Continents devide,
And lonely thoughts collide
Our heaven will allow no distance now.

I can always close my eyes
Take your absence by surprise,
Hold my breath and make believe.

As simple as breathing
I picture your face,
All tangled in daydreams
And sheilded with grace.

There's somewhere in my heart only for you.

If I must do without
I'll let these sparks fly out
Across this wilderness
From me to you.

Wherever you may be
Lift up your hand for me.
There's somewhere in my heart only for you.
