Let it rain, let it rain.
Open the floodgates of heaven
Repeat

The lord reigns, let the earth be glad
Let the distance shores rejoice
Clouds and thick darkness surround him
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne
A fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side
His lightning lights up the world
The earth sees and trembles
The mountains melt like wax before the lord
Before the lord of all the earth
The heavens proclaim his righteousness
And all peoples will see his glory

We want to see your glory, god!
Do you want to see his glory?
Lift your voices, lift your hands!

Let it rain, let it rain.
Open the floodgates of heaven
Let it rain, let it rain.
Open the floodgates of heaven
