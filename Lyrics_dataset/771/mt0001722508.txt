Sorry, I never told you, all I wanted to say. 
Now it's too late to hold you. '
Cause you've flown away, so far away.

Never, Had I imagined, yeah, living without your smile. 
Feelin' and knowing you hear me. 
It keeps me alive. Alive!

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven,
Like so many friends we've lost along the way, 
And I know eventually we'll be together.
One sweet day. 

Picture a little scene from Heaven.

Darling, I never showed you.
Assumed you'd always be there.
I took your presence for granted.
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared.

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven.
Like so many friends we've lost along the way.
And I know eventually we'll be together.
One sweet day. 

Picture a little scene from Heaven.

Although, the sun will never shine the same, I'll 
always look to a brighter day.

Yeah, Lord, I know, when I lay me down to sleep,
You'll always listen, as I pray!

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven,
Like so many friends we've lost along the way, 
And I know eventually we'll be together.
One sweet day. 

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven,
Like so many friends we've lost along the way, 
And I know eventually we'll be together.
One sweet day. 

Sorry, I Never told you, all I wanted to say
