Just when you are near
When I hold you fast
Then my dreams will whisper
You're too lovely to last.

Lips are saying "Love"
All worries have passed
And then I get that feeling
You're too lovely to last.

Will I ever know a real love?
So I can forget you
Will I always have to still love?
What am I to do?

Soon the night is gone
Dreams are fading fast
Then I wake up knowing
You're too lovely to last.

Will I ever know a real love?
So I can forget you
Will I always have to still love?
What am I to do?

Soon the night is gone
Dreams are fading fast
Then I wake up knowing
You're too lovely to last
Baby you're too lovely
You're much too lovely to last
