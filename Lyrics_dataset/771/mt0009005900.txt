Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothing new
I learned to play the guitar and I'm doing the best I can
I guess I could be worse cause I made the prison band, I made the prison band

Now there's old bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Pocatella where he drags a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum there's two time Tom, our rim-shot tempo man
The boys call me their singin' emcee since I made the prison band, I made the prison band

I've been planning a break since Christmas, I had the details all worked out
Now I know that I ain't gonna' go and there's no doubt
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plan
I gotta' rehearse for the Friday night show cause I made the prison band, I made the prison band

Now there's old bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Pocatella where he drags a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum there's two time Tom, our rim-shot tempo man
The boys call me their singin' emcee since I made the prison band,I made the prison band
