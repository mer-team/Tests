I can't stop loving you so I made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you mhm it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those happy hours mhm that we once knew
So long ago still make me blue
And they say that time heels a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you...
