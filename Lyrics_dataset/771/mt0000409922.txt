You wrap your arms around 
A feeling that surrounds 
Like liquid peppermint 
Just taste the drinks that she served 

And this feeling shivers down your spine 
Love comes in colors I can't deny 
All that matters is love, love, your love 

You're sleeping in your bed 
Just rest your weary head 
Maybe you shouldn't care 
Throw away those dreams and dare 

And I wonder if it matters to me 
Love comes in colors I can't deny 
All that shimmers is love, love, your love 
Your love 
Your love
