I double dare you to come over here
I double dare you to lend me your ear
Take off your high hat and let's get friendly
Don't be a scaredy cat, 
hey whaddaya care, 
can'tcha take a dare?
I double dare you to kiss me and then
I double dare you to kiss me again
And if that look in your eye means what I'm thinkin' of
I double dare you to fall in love with me
I double dare you!
