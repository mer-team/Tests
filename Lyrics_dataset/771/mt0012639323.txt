A Well repsected man
'Cause he gets up in the morning,
and he goes to work at nine,
and he comes back home at five-thirty,
gets the same train every time.
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality,
it never fails.

And he's oh, so good,
and he's oh, so fine,
and he's oh, so healthy,
in his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
doing the best things so conservatively.

And his mother goes to meetings,
while his father pulls the maid,
and she stirs the tea with councilors,
while discussing foreign trade,
and she passes looks, as well as bills
at every suave young man.

And he's oh, so good,
and he's oh, so fine,
and he's oh, so healthy,
in his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
doing the best things so conservatively.

And he likes his own backyard,
and he likes his fags the best,
'cause he's better than the rest,
and his own sweat smells the best,
and he hopes to grab his father's loot
when Pater passes on.

And he's oh, so good,
and he's oh, so fine,
and he's oh, so healthy,
in his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
doing the best things so conservatively.

And he plays at stocks and shares,
and he goes to the Regatta,
and he adores the girl next door,
'cause he's dying to get at her,
but his mother knows the best about
the matrimonial stakes.

And he's oh, so good,
and he's oh, so fine,
and he's oh, so healthy,
in his body and his mind.
He's a well respected man about town,
doing the best things so conservatively.
