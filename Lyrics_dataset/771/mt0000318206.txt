Go!
Forever falling, into oblivion
The darkness crawls forward
It engulfs my will to live
Fear is failure
And this is my motivation

Take back what was stolen
Reclaim all that's lost
With virtue, I will rise up from the ruins

Come on!
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am, unbroken

Take back what was stolen
Embrace the circle
Refuse to turn back now and be led astray
Fear is failure
And this is my affirmation

Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
I am unbroken
Through adversity, there is redemption
With passion, fighting
Unbroken

The absence of fear
Is the renewal of our self
The absence of doubt
Breeds desire
If there is truth to face
I will design it
I will not be denied!

Unbroken
I will not be denied
I will not be denied
