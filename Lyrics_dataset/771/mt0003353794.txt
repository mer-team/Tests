Through the back window of our '59 wagon
I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try how can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
She said how can I help you...

Sitting with mama alone in her bedroom
She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now my time here is over
And with her final words she tried to help me understand
Mama whispered softly...
