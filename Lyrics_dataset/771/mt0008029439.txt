We got winners
We got losers
Chain-smokers and boozers
We got yuppies
We got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar

We got cowboys
We got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers
We got fighters
Early-birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar

I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far
Come as you are
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar

I've seen short skirts
We've got high-techs
Blue-collared boys and rednecks
And we got lovers
Lots of lookers
I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar
(Yes I do)

Toby: I like my truck
Crowd: I like my truck

Toby: And I like my girlfriend
Crowd: I like my girlfriend

Toby: I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just toein' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge
Come as you are
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I just love this old bar

And we've got divorcees
A big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We've got waitresses
And we've got bar flies
A dumb-ass and a wise guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car
Reason number 672 why
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I just love this bar

Play it on out boy
Take it on home

Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar
I just love it
