No matter what's still not over you
Today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd be
I had to know if you still had the same affect on me
And the moment that I saw you there I knew
No matter what I do I'm still not over you
I can't explain why seeing you affects my sanity
But when I see you I become strange and differently
And the moment that I saw you there I knew
No matter what I do I'm still not over you
I'm still not over you that feeling's still the same
I'm still not over you I find that nothing's changed
And perhaps some day I'll find somebody new
But now it's much too soon I'm still not over you
No matter what I do I'm still not over you
