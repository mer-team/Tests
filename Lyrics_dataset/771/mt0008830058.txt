Oh, please help me, oh please help me, I'm livin' by myself.
I need someone to comfort me, I need someone to tell.

I'm sorry for the things I've done,
I've shamed myself with lies,
But soon these things are overcome and can't be recognized.

I left my home with ribbons on and water in her eyes.
I took from her the love I'd won and turned it to the sky.

I'm sorry for the things I've done,
I've shamed myself with lies,
My cruelty has punctured me and now I'm running dry.
