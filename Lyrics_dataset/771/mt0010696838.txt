If U touch the television, I'll kill U Sophie

Sol, can U please change the channel 4 God's sake?
I don't care, leave it alone, sit down!

I can't stand David Letterman, he looks like a banker 

U don't have 2 watch Dynasty 2 have an attitude
Leave it all up 2 me, my love will be, will be your food
Everybody will have short hair
Let's cut it, mama! (Pretty mama)

I just want your extra time and your... kiss

Oh my God, isn't that Prince on television, Sol? {fade out}

OK Sophie, it's obvious
No, wait a minute, I bought this television
Why'd... why U ruin it 4 me 4 God's sake?

Is he the strangest lookin' thing U've ever seen or what?

U wanna talk strange Sophie? OK, let's talk strange

Sol, don't U touch that channel!
Leave it alone, Sol!
