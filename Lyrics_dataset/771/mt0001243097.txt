spoken: 
I was walkin'home from school 
on a cold winter day, 
took a short cut through the woods 
and I lost my way. 
It was gettin' late, and I was scared and alone. 
Then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home. 
sung: mama couldn't see him, 
but he was standing there, 
and I knew in my heart 
he was the answer to my prayer. 

Chorus: 
Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us, 
sent down to us from somewhere up above. 
They come to you and me in our darkest hours 
to show us how to live 
to teach us how to give 
to guide us with a light of love. 


Verse 2 
When life held troubled times 
and had me down on my knees 
there's always been someone 
to come along and comfort me 
a kind word from a stranger 
to lend a helping hand 
a phone call from a friend 
just to say I understand 
Now ain't it kind of funny 
at the dark end of the road 
someone light the way with just a single ray of hope. 

repeat Chorus 

Bridge: 
They wear so many faces, 
show up in the strangest places 
and grace us with their mercies in our time of need. 

repeat chorus 

to guide us with a light of love
