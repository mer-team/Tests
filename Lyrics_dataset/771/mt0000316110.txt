I'm obssesed and deranged
For I am destined to rule
And I just cant believe that you are such a fool

I want want your sweet devotion
I dont need your cheap emotion
You will do as you are told
Till the rights to you are sold

Don't you blow your top
Are you hung up

Think I go and start my car,
To have a real adventure
Like some Czecky little creap
Really dick her she's so freaky

Once you were my one and only
Took my stash and left me lonely

Don't you blow your top
Are you hung up

Give me your dirty love
