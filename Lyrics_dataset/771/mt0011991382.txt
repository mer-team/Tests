I got the answers to all of your questions
If you've got the money to pay me in gold
I will be living in old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading the secrets of soul

Daggers and contacts and bright shiny limos
I've got a watch that turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns, poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks

And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash
Halo of flies

I crossed the ocean where no one could see
And I put a time-bomb in your submarine
Goodbye to old friends, the secret's in hand
With full need of papers and counterfeit plans
You never will understand
