When in love with a blind man
You watch what you say
And you watch yourself burn
With dreams of escaping
Make love to the man who shapes your behavior

When in love with a blind man
You love on your own
To an occasional smile
You never know why but sometimes he smiles
And sometimes just lies there, so jealous
