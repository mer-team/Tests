Oh lordy, trouble so hard 
oh lordy, trouble so hard, 
don't nobody know my troubles but God 
don't nobody know my troubles but God 

Went down the hill, other day 
soul got happy and stayed all day 

Went in the room, didn't stay long, 
looked on the bed and brother was dead  

Oh lordy, trouble so hard 
oh lordy, trouble so hard, 
don't nobody know my troubles but God 
don't nobody know my troubles but God 

Oh lordy, trouble so hard 
oh lordy, trouble so hard, 
don't nobody know my troubles but God 
don't nobody know my troubles but God
