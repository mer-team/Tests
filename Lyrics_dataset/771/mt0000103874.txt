Tell you why I called on you 
This is what we're going to do 
Take this lovely gift of love 
Sent to us from Heaven above 

I said, baby I think that 
We can help each other see (oh yeah) 
We'd make this life that we're living seem 
More like it's supposed to be 

Well every man should have a good woman 
Every woman should have a good man 
Won't you stand along beside me 
Let me do the best I can 
Take each other's heart in hand. 

I want to sing just a little love song 
I want to sing for a little while 
Back up and toe the line for you 
I want to be your all in all. 

Bless you babe, I love you so 
Love from whom all blessings flow 
Me to you and you to me 
This is how it's going to be 
I said baby we're gonna know the joy 
the years can bring (oh yeah) 
And every time I think about it 
I just want to lift my heart 
And sing (on more time) 

Every man should have a good woman 
Every woman should have a good man 
Won't you stand along beside me 
Let me do the best I can 
Take each other's heart in hand. 

Bless you babe, I love you so 
Love from whom all blessings flow 
Me to you and you to me 
This is how it's going to be 
I said baby we're gonna know the joy 
the years can bring (oh yeah) 
And every time I think about it 
I just want to lift my heart 
And sing (on more time)
