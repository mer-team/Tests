It's tricky when
You feel that someone
Has done something 
On your behalf 

It's slippery when 
Your sense of justice 
Murmurs underneath 
And you're asking yourself:

How am I going to make it right? 

With a palmful of stars 
I shake them like dice
Repeatedly
I throw them on the table 
Until the desired constellation appears 
And I ask myself:

How am I going to make it right?
How am I going to make it right?
