I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good, and then then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye, to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand, and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun, and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing somewhere everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thiking on a dismal day
And song songs for us to bare

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye, to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand, and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun, and one more lonely night
